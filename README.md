A new Flutter Portfolio application.

# Portfolio App

This project is a starting point for a Flutter Portfolio application.

This is a Portfolio App. Since, I saw many portfolio websites all over the net, but no portfolio apps. As a app developer I wanted to create one for my own satisfaction. So, here you go, my Porfolio App, named "Varshaa". 

## Getting Started

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://flutter.dev/docs/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter, view our
[online documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.
